# Learning the basics of SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL lets you access and manipulate databases.

A database is a collection of data that is organized in a manner that facilitates ease of access, as well as effcient management and updating. It is made up of table that store relevant information. 

A table stores and displays data in a structured format consisting of colums and rows that are similar to those seen in Excel spreadsheet each designed for a specific purpose. 

A primary key is the a field in the table that uniquely indentifis the table records. It must contain a unique value for each row and can not contain NULL values. *(A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.)*
